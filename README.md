# Mad_Lips_Generator
We all know how fun Mad Lib Theater is. This program is a trial to bring that essence to user through python. (I know, the name says Mad "Lip", not a typo, but that always seemed more appropriate to me)

Download the script and open in Python Environmen. Run the program and answer simple questions to generate various funny conversations. 
Enjoy and do check out my other projects.
